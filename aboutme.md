subtitle: A "little" about me
---

I am Advait Marathe , If you were to ask me to describe myself in one sentence , it would not be possible but I'll try to be brief , 
I'm a tech nerd who likes to think out of the box , take paths most fear from taking and challenge norms most don't challenge :


## My Hobbies (Tech Related)

I love building stuff weather be software or hardware , Everything I build is Built with purpose.

I also break stuff (not actually) , in the sense that I'm a curious person by nature so 
I take things apart to see how it works , then try to put it back in one piece


## Other Hobbies of mine

While Tech is a BIG chunk of my life ,  I have other interests like:
  
  - Reading Books , from novels to self-help books , I read it all :) 
  - Listening to music
  - Playing badminton
